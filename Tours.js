Dating back to the 1st century AD, Petra once thrived as the Nabatean commercial empire’s capital. Forgotten for centuries, it was rediscovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. Accessible solely through the narrow passage known as the Siq, Petra is nestled on the precipice of Wadi Aruba, encircled by towering canyon walls and hills.
Our guided tour guides us through the winding Siq, a narrow passage that rises 200 meters and narrows to just 2 meters wide. We’ll pass the terracotta pipes that once conveyed water into the city and the ancient Nabatean water channel. Upon emerging from the Siq, we’ll be mesmerized by the sight of the Khazneh, also known as the Treasury, one of Petra’s most magnificent landmarks. Our exploration continues to the Roman amphitheater, colonnaded streets, and the multi-colored sandstone cliffs leading to the Monastery, Petra’s grandest carved monument, standing at an impressive 50 meters in height and 45 meters in width. The vistas of Wadi Aruba and the Jordan Valley from this vantage point are simply awe-inspiring.
Following an unforgettable day in Petra, we journey to Wadi Rum, an awe-inspiring desert landscape characterized by towering rock formations and cliffs. Here, we’re welcomed by hospitable Bedouin hosts and make ourselves at home in a comfortable campsite beneath the starlit sky. Indulging in a delectable traditional Jordanian meal, we spend the evening gathered around the campfire, stargazing, and relishing the serenity of this magnificent desert backdrop.

Following our Wadi Rum adventure, we’ll journey northward to the shores of the Dead Sea. This remarkable body of water holds the distinction of being the Earth’s lowest point, situated more than 400 meters below sea level. It receives waters from various sources, including the Jordan River, and the convergence of these waters leaves behind a unique amalgamation of salts and minerals, contributing to the production of high-quality local products.
We’ll pause for a swim in the Dead Sea, an extraordinary experience unlike any other. Thanks to its remarkably high salt concentration, you’ll effortlessly float on its surface, creating a truly unforgettable and unique encounter. Just remember to avoid getting the water in your eyes, as it can be quite uncomfortable.
After savoring this distinctive swim in the Dead Sea, we’ll make our way back to Amman, savoring the picturesque views of the hills of Jerusalem along the journey. This region is historically associated with five biblical cities: Sodom, Gomorrah, Adman, Zebouin, and Zoar (Bela).
